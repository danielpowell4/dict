#Dict

**Dict** is a messenger bot powered by facebook's wit.ai.

Currently in an initial Beta soft launch, Dict uses natural language processing to power you education of a new word each day.

##Powered by Wit.ai
The real "bot" conversational code isn't here. This repository represents the backbone of a basic scaffolded Rails API, which serves up a basic word, sentence, definition, and trick based upon the day of the year.

If you are hungry to build a bot, I encourage you to head over to wit.ai(https://wit.ai) and deploy with their awesome [witty_fiddle](https://wit-ai.github.io/witty-fiddle/).

## In the wild

Find us in the messenger app by shooting a message to "Dict"
